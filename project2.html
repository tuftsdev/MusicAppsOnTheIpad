<h1>Music Apps on the iPad</h1>
<h2>COMP 150-ISW, Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Spring 2015</h2>
</div>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>For your final project, your team will develop a functional music application. It can be standalone, or work in conjunction with MIDI input and/or output. It can also work with audio input.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<h3>Guidelines and Restrictions</h3>
<ol>
<li>The app shall not be used for organizing or downloading music libraries.</li>
<li>The app shall not be not be a "DJ"-style app for manipulating playback of non-original music files.</li>
<li>Teams are allowed to make changes or additions to their project proposal after it is finalized (e.g., during the middle of the semester) <span class="stress">with consent of the instructors.</span></li>
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>There are four deliverables for this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Project Proposal Presentation (<span class="note">on Thursday, March 26th</span>) - Project proposal must explain (1) the problem your team is trying to solve or (2) why your team chose this project.  Your team will present project proposal to the class.  The instructors have to approve the proposal and may suggest changes.</li>
<li>Design Presentation (<span class="note">on Thursday, April 2nd</span>) - Your team will present design to the class. The design must outline:
<ul>
<li>Core functionality of app</li>
<li>Source (music/sound) requirements</li>
<li>Inputs and outputs</li>
<li>Anticipated challenges</li>
<li>Mockup user interface screenshots (drawn electronically only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User Interface Presentation (<span class="note">on Thursday, April 9th</span>) - The purpose of this presentation is to make sure that your team has started building the app and to review the user interface.  It is important that your app reasonably follows the Apple Human Interface Guidelines (the H.I.G): <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH1-SW1" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH1-SW1</a></li>
<li>App Demo (<span class="note">last week of classes</span>)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Your app will be graded on six factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="stress">Functionality</span> - Something that works consistently. Remember, an app with fewer features that work is significantly better than one with numerous features, in which some either do not work or are buggy.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Production</span> - We are looking for an app that is polished (e.g., graphics), consistent (e.g., look-and-feel), and reasonably professional.  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH1-SW1" target="_blank">Did you follow the Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)?</a></li>
<li><span class="stress">Complexity</span> - The more original your app is, the better.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Usefulness / Fun</span> - Does your app fulfill a recognized need among professional musicians or educators, or is it just fun (or both)?</li>
<li><span class="stress">Learning Curve</span> - Is the app easy to understand at first, and does it offer a more rewarding experience as the user gets to know it?</li>
<li><span class="stress">Technical Competency</span> - Use <a href="http://kotaku.com/5975610/the-exceptional-beauty-of-doom-3s-source-code" target="_blank">good programming practices</a>, consistent Git commits and pushes, meaningful Git commit messages used.</li>
</ol>
